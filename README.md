## Features

### Warp Gate Enhancements

Once you have activated the progenitor warp gate, any player that comes within 50m of the gate will trigger a dialog message allowing them to activate the gate. This starts a 90 second countdown after which all players and entities (with the exception of BAs) within 500m of the warp gate will be teleported to a random location on the other side of the gate. The gate will enter a 5 minute cooldown period after activation (the portal will remain accessible). Choosing not to warp will put the gate on a 2 minute cooldown before it will prompt the player again.
